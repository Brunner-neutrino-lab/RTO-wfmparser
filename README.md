The R&S RTO2000 oscilloscope can save digitized waveforms to a buffer using the fast segmentation feature. When exporting the waveforms, the data is stored in a single csv file with an associated configuration file. The readfile.py program will read the configuration file, then reconstruct the waveform data accordingly. Each waveform is individually analysed with a baseline correction function and is corrected, then the waveforms are saved in a numpy data structure. If timestamps are recorded, then timestamps are interleaved into the csv file. The readfile program will detect weather timestamps are also recorded and alter the decoding process accordingly. Absolute timestamps can be recorded by selecting the absolute timestamps feature in the fast segmentation menu, and the timestamps option must be selected when saving the buffer.

A sample analysis file is included to show how to access the data after it has been processed, and a sample waveform file is included to demonstrate the program. In the sample waveform file there are 10 waveforms, and the first sample is holding the timestamp of the first waveform.
