The R&S RTO2000 scope can save digitized waveforms to a buffer using the fast segmentation feature. When exporting the waveforms, the data is stored in a single csv file with an associated configuration file. The readfile.py program will read the configuration file then reconstruct the waveform data accordingly. Each waveform is individually analysed with a baseline correction function and is corrected for any baseline offset in the waveform. The waveforms are then saved in a numpy data structure. If timestamps are recorded, then timestamps are interleaved into the csv file. The readfile program will detect weather timestamps are also recorded and alter the decoding process accordingly. A sample analysis file is included to show how to access the data after it has been processed.
A sample scope waveform file is included. 

In this file there are 10 waveforms, and the first sample is holding the timestamp for the first waveform.
